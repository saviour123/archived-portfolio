subtitle: Writing a good email is as sweet as a good essay well layout, you email may need some polishing.


Having worked with Google students email for sometime, I've realized that some students need to work on 
their emailing skills. I have outline some tips that would help you.

The following are some tips.

## Don't Over Communicate.

Keep messages clear and brief. Be polite. Check your tone- avoid the usage of jargons, shorthands. Read through your email before hitting send.

Type your message before entering the email and pay attention to the styling. 
SUBJECT area: Use this column to get a suitable topic for your email. It should be related to you message. It should not be longer than four words.


## Never Type All your messages in the Subject area.  

Its the baddest thing you can ever do to your email. Further, use:

### **cc** 
_copy_: It copies message to other people and its the same as typing multiple emails separated by comma, in the recipient column.

### **bcc** 
_blind carbon copy_: This function copies message to people without showing their email to other recipients.

Always:

Open,  your email with salutations, and begin your body on a new line.

Conclude your email with words like with regards, cheers etc. also on new line

## Example

    Subject: Enquires About 2014 Admissions

    Good afternoon,

    I recently applied as an undergraduate student to read computer engineering at Legon.

    I would like to know when admissions would be out.

    Hope to hear from you soon.

    Thank You.

    With Regards

Be Concise, straight to the point, use paragraphs in your email as may apply.
