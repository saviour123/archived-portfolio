subtitle: I get a lot of messages about lost or stolen phones, so I want to share some tips that can help you before or after phone is missing.


Losing your phone is one of the painful experiences in life because of the contacts, photos and other documents that are not backup up. Before I share any tip remember, 

## **Backup Is Key**
Make sure to backup your phone with Google services, Google photos for Photos, contact with Google contacts and Google Drive for other important documents.

## For  a Missing phone

I have use all and located my mum's lost phone, thats is the good news.


### 1. AndroidLost or Plan B.

This can be remotely installed from a PC with your android Gmail account from PlayStore.

Depending on your android version, install the Plan b or AndroidLost.

With android lost, navigate to androidlost.com

And see several commands including activating your GPS by just a text message.


This works even if your phone is stolen. You can remotely install it and track as well as getting text messages from your phone. Its a lightweight app that all android users must install.


### 2. Avast Antitheft.

_Avast Anti Theft and not Antivirus_

This is by far the most robust Anti Theft app I have use. It has a login console where you can
track and manage your phone life.
This also gives you a real time tracking and it is best to install it before the phone get missing. It can prevent the phone from accepting a factory reset. Isn't this wonderful. <em>Install, open and register your avast once you install it</em>

Next time you lost your phone. Run quickly to avast.com sign in with your account and see the location of your phone on map.



3. Android Device Manager.

Install this as well. Many soup cannot spoil the soup.

It allows you to see the location of your phone or for tracking your partner. All you need is the Gmail account of the target and password. The software allows you to track the lost or other phone from another android device.


Pls. Note.

Go to location setting and enable it on your android.

Install at least 2 of the 3 apps above, they are all lightweight apps not more than 4mb from the playstore.

 as well as the androidlost.

If your phone is missing, there is hope with androidlost or plan b, android device manager. And also try tracking the phone very early before your thief gets smart. Don't wait for your phone to be stolen before you secure it.
