subtitle: I get a lot of messages about lost or stolen phones, so I want to share some tips that can help you before or after phone is missing.


Losing your phone is one of the painful experiences in life because of the contacts, photos and other documents that are not backup up. Before I share any tip remember,

### **Backup Is Key**

Make sure to back up your phone with Google services, Google photos for Photos, contact with Google contacts and Google Drive for other important documents.
For a Missing phone

I've used all and located my mum's lost phone, that's is the good news.

### 1. AndroidLost or Plan B.

This can be remotely installed from a PC with your Android Gmail account from PlayStore.

Depending on your android version, install the Plan B or AndroidLost.

With android lost, navigate to androidlost.com

And see several commands including activating your GPS by just a text message.

This works even if your phone is stolen. You can remotely install it and track as well as getting text messages from your phone. It is a small app that all android users must install.

### 2. Avast Antitheft.

Avast Anti Theft and not Antivirus

This is by far the most robust Anti Theft app I have used. It has a login console where you can track and manage your phone life. This also gives you a real-time tracking and it is best to install it before the phone gets missing. It can prevent the phone from accepting a factory reset. Isn't this wonderful? Install and set it up once you install it

Next time you lost your phone. Run quickly to avast.com sign in with your account and see the location of your phone on the map.

### 3. Android Device Manager.

This is Android's default device manager. You may want to have this also set up. It's quite easy and simple to start with.

It allows you to see the location of your phone. You can add other devices you want to track. All you need is the Gmail account your phone or target phone and password. The software allows you to track the lost phone from another android device.

_NB:_ - Go to location settings on your phone and enable it on your android.

Install at least 2 of the 3 apps above, they are all lightweight apps not more than 4mb from the Google PlayStore.

> If your phone is missing, there is hope with AndroidLost, Plan B or Android Device Manager.
Don't delay too much before you start tracking the phone, your thief may get smart. Don't wait for your phone to be stolen before you secure it.
